Bus Protocol:

[Ignoring for the moment the very complex activity when the PC Printer
option is attached, sticking only to what can be observed while
interacting at the keyboard.]

The protocol uses a 9-bit serial protocol at 187050 baud with transmit
and receive appearing on the same wire. The transmitting device pulls
the bus to ground to indicate a zero or allows to pulled high to
indicate a one. Each byte is acknowledged, usually with zeros, but
sometimes with a reply value.

A command sequence begins by transmitting 0x121 to put the receiver at
address 0x21 on notice that the command is for it. Other receivers are
allowed to ignore the rest of the message. The reply is uniformily
zero, but the command initiator needs to wait for the reply before
proceeding. The command initiator then sends a command code (0x00
through 0x0e). Each command has a fixed number of argument btyes that
follow, which vary by command.
